# SlicerPhotogrammetry
An extension to preprocess (masking) large collection photographs which then can be passed to [Open Drone Map (ODM) engine](https://www.opendronemap.org/) to construct 3D models with texture. 
See [Zhang and Maga (2023) An Open-Source Photogrammetry Workflow for Reconstructing 3D Models](https://academic.oup.com/iob/article/5/1/obad024/7221338) on how to take pictures of specimens using a low-cost step up and optionally use Aruco markers to obtain physical scale of the object.
