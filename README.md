# SlicerPhotogrammetry
An extension to preprocess (masking) large collection photographs which then can be processed to construct 3D models with texture. 
See [Zhang and Maga (2023) An Open-Source Photogrammetry Workflow for Reconstructing 3D Models](https://academic.oup.com/iob/article/5/1/obad024/7221338) on how to take pictures of specimens using a low-cost step up and optionally use Aruco markers to obtain physical scale of the object.

## Usage Instructions

## Funding Acknowledgement
Photogrammetry extension is supported by grants (DBI/2301405, OAC/2118240) from National Science Foundation to AMM (Seattle Children's Research Institute) 

## Acknowledgement
Photogrammety extension uses the [Segment Anything Model](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) to segment foreground object. For stereophotogrammetic reconstuction the extension uses the [pyODM package from the Open Drone Map project](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/PyODM).
